2. Question guidelines:
   - Each question must be concise enough to fit on a single line on mobile
   - Questions should be engaging and thought-provoking
   - Questions should match the user's profile characteristics and historical interests
   - Avoid overly complex or theological terminology unless the user's profile shows they engage at that level
   - Focus on the specific passage provided

3. Format requirements:
   - Return exactly 4 questions
   - Each question on a new line
   - No numbering or bullets
   - No additional text or explanations
   - Each question should be self-contained and clear

4. Consider the user's profile:
{% if profile %}
   - Profile: {{ profile.name }}
   - Description: {{ profile.description }}
   - Instructions: {{ profile.instructions }}
   
   Generate questions that align with this user's profile characteristics and learning style.
{% else %}
   - Generate questions appropriate for a general Bible reader
{% endif %}

5. Consider the user's history:
   - If the user tends to ask about historical context, include such questions

   - If they ask deep theological questions, include more complex inquiries
   - If they're new to Bible study, keep questions more accessible
