# Gamaliel Prompts & Transparency

**Your Questions. Biblical Answers. Open Source.**

Gamaliel Prompts is the open-source heart of the [Gamaliel.ai](https://gamaliel.ai) projectâ€”a next-generation, AI-powered Bible study companion. This repository contains all the prompt templates, user profiles, and theological guardrails that power the biblical reasoning and transparency of the Gamaliel system.

## Vision & Mission

Gamaliel exists to make deep, trustworthy Bible study accessible to everyoneâ€”whether you're a curious seeker, a lifelong believer, or anywhere in between. Inspired by the mentorship of the biblical Gamaliel to the Apostle Paul, our goal is to provide clear, scripturally-rooted answers to your questions, with complete transparency about how those answers are generated.

## Theological Foundation

Gamaliel operates within clear theological guardrails rooted in historic Christian orthodoxy. Our system is built on two foundational principles:

### Core Christian Doctrines (Nicene Creed)
All responses must affirm the essential beliefs shared by Nicene-affirming Christian traditions:
- **The Trinity**: One God in three personsâ€”Father, Son, and Holy Spirit
- **The Incarnation**: Jesus Christ as fully God and fully man
- **The Gospel**: Christ's death, resurrection, and ascension for our salvation
- **The Church**: One holy, catholic (universal), and apostolic Church
- **The Future**: Resurrection of the dead and life everlasting

### Authority of Scripture
- **Divine Inspiration**: The Bible is the inspired, authoritative, and trustworthy word of God
- **Scriptural Sufficiency**: All doctrine and teaching must be consistent with Scripture
- **Historical Context**: Scripture is interpreted in light of the historic Christian faith

These guardrails ensure that Gamaliel provides biblically faithful responses while respecting the diversity of Christian traditions. See our [theological guardrails](theologies/) for specific denominational perspectives.

**ðŸ“‹ Complete Theological Guardrails**: See [guardrails.md](guardrails.md) for the complete, authoritative list of mandatory core theological guardrails that all responses must follow.

## Why Transparency?

Just as open source builds trust in software, we believe open prompts and theological guardrails build trust in AI-powered biblical study. All system instructions, prompt templates, and theological perspectives are public, so that scholars, theologians, and the community can audit, improve, and verify the system's biblical fidelity and theological soundness. See our [AI Transparency Strategy](../docs/ai-transparency-strategy.md) for more details.
