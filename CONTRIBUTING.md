# Contributing to Gamaliel Prompts

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the open-source heart of Gamaliel.ai! Our mission is to make trustworthy, transparent, and biblically faithful AI-powered Bible study accessible to all. Your expertise and passion can help us build a resource that serves seekers, believers, and scholars worldwide.

## Theological Guardrails

All contributions must align with our foundational theological principles:

### Core Christian Doctrines
Contributions must affirm the essential beliefs of the Nicene Creed:
- **The Trinity**: One God in three persons—Father, Son, and Holy Spirit
- **The Incarnation**: Jesus Christ as fully God and fully man  
- **The Gospel**: Christ's death, resurrection, and ascension for our salvation
- **The Church**: One holy, catholic (universal), and apostolic Church
- **The Future**: Resurrection of the dead and life everlasting

### Authority of Scripture
- **Divine Inspiration**: The Bible is the inspired, authoritative, and trustworthy word of God
- **Scriptural Sufficiency**: All doctrine and teaching must be consistent with Scripture
- **Historical Context**: Scripture is interpreted in light of the historic Christian faith

These guardrails ensure biblical fidelity while respecting the diversity of Christian traditions. See our [theological guardrails](theologies/) for specific denominational perspectives.

## What You Can Contribute

- **User Profiles**: Expand our set of YAML profiles to better serve diverse audiences and spiritual backgrounds.
- **Theological Guardrails**: Refine or add denominational/theological YAMLs to ensure biblical fidelity and doctrinal clarity.
